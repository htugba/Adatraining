- For predefined types;
	type My_Type is range -1 .. 20;
	Put_Line (My_Type'Image (I));
- ** is the exponent operator
- abs( ) is absolute value operator
- There are two types of overflow checks;
	- Machine-level overflow : exceeds the max/min value 
	storage reserved for an object of the type.
	- Type-level overflow : outside the range defined for the type.
- 'Size is used to retrieve the number of bits used for the specified data type
- Defining a type with a precision
	- type T6_type is digits 6 range -1.0e-4 .. 1.0e-4;
- a value of one type cannot be assigned to a variable from the other type.
	-- even if they created from same type
- Type conversions must be made explicit
- To convert a type to another type functions can be used.
- To create new types based on existing ones;
	type New_type is new Integer range 0 .. 10;
	-- New_type is a derived type --> its parent type is Integer
- While defining a derived type that its parent is a enum type, range operator can be used.
- enforce constraints on some values while staying within a single type -> subtypes
