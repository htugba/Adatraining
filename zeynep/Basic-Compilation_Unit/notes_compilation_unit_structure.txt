- Ada compilation units are generally split into two parts;
 	- the specification,
	- the body
- compilation units are stored in files --> .ads extension
- implementations --> .adb extension
- with clause is different from how include work in C++
- with clause directs the compiler to make the public interface of a package visible to code in the unit containing the with clause
- use clause --> using namespace in C++ / import in Java
- package -> compilation unit
- private part of a package --> protected member of a C++ or Java class.
- An entity declared in the body of an Ada package -> private member of a C++ or Java class.
