Task can be called as a thread, and tasking can be called as multithreading.

When you define a thread in a package, "with package" thread starts automatically. If you dont want starting auto, 
then use "entry" task and accept this task when calling is needed.

protectedObjects : When multiple tasks are accessing shared data, corruption of that data may occur. 
		   Protected objects encapsulate data and provide access to that data by means of protected operations:
			-subprograms (get, set subprograms are used)
			-protected entries (entry keyword is used)

You can created types from Task and Protected objects with "type" keyword.
