Pre and post conditions provide expectations regarding input and output parameters of subprograms and return value of functions.
It is used like:
	with Pre => <condition>
	with Post => <condition>

pragma is used to force the compiler to generate code to check the pre or post condition. 

You can use pre and post conditions together:
	procedure example with Pre  => ..., Post => ...;

Predicates provide expectations for Types.
Static and dynamic predicates are specified using the following clauses:
	with Static_Predicate => <property>
	with Dynamic_Predicate => <property>
