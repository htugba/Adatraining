To specify the default value for a component, you can use the "<>" notation.
	type Point is record
      		X, Y : Integer := 0;
   		end record;
	type Point_Array is array (Positive range <>) of Point;

You can use the "|" symbol to give several components the same value.
	Origin   : Point := (X | Y => <>);

You can use the "others" choice to refer to every component that has not yet been specified, provided all those fields have the same type.
	Origin_2 : Point := (others => <>);

You can use the range notation ".." to refer to specify a contiguous sequence of indices in an array.
	Points_2 : Point_Array := (1 => (1, 2), 2 => (3, 4), 3 .. 20 => <>);

Overloading can be used in Ada. Ada can have functions that have the same name, but different types for their parameters.

delta: A reserved word, used in declaring a fixed-point type. It determines the precision or spacing between adjacent values. (Delta is also an attribute.)	
	type T3_D3 is delta 10.0 ** (-3) digits 3;  --The delta value of T3_D3 is 0.001
						    --The minimum value of T3_D3 is -0.999
						    --The maximum value of T3_D3 is 0.999
   	type T6_D3 is delta 10.0 ** (-3) digits 6;  --The delta value of T6_D3 is 0.001
						    --The minimum value of T6_D3 is -999.999
						    --The maximum value of T6_D3 is 999.999
	D : constant := 2.0 ** (-31);
   	type TQ31 is delta D range -1.0 .. 1.0 - D; --TQ31 requires 32 bits
